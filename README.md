# Statistical-Analysis-of-Global-Population-Growth-Trends-and-their-Implications-for-Policy-
The primary objective of this analysis is to understand the trends in population growth across various countries from 1962 to 2023 and to investigate whether the rates of population growth differ significantly between certain countries. 
Key questions that arise from this problem include:
1. How has the population growth rate of individual countries evolved over time?
2. Is there a significant difference in population growth trends between countries (e.g., India vs China)?
3. Is there an association between certain time periods and population growth rates?
